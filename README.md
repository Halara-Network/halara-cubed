# About the modpack
_HalaraÂ³_ ("Halara Cubed") for Minecraft: Java Edition is a compilation of hundreds mods by a dozens of authors. This modpack aims to implement the 'big mods' of the golden age of Minecraft, refurbished and updated for the modern day. The pack features mods such as Applied Energetics 2 (AE2), Thermal Foundations, Create, Botania, Mekanism, OpenBlocks Elevators, and more. The avenues of expansion for the modpack lean heavily on technology and engineering, but there's a few bits and bobs added in the mix to enhance the roleplay and explorative aspects of the game as well. Oh, and _halara_ is a Greek slang term most closely relates to "take it easy".
