Notes:
First update in March since Lucky Block Pink 5.1 which released on March 17th, 2017.
This update introduces some drops which affect multiple entities, they might be removed in the future, but I want to see how it goes.
The amount of drops added and removed in this update, balanced each other out. Meaning this update as same amount of drops as Lucky Block Pink 7.0 [Did Somebody Say Update].
This update features the oldest reintroduction of a drop to date when adjusted for time, being the Lucky Dungeon from Lucky Block Pink 1 Year Anniversary Edition and earlier.
This update is up there with Lucky Block Pink 2.0 V2, Lucky Block Pink 6.1 [Blend of New and Old Update], and Lucky Block Pink 6.9 [Combat and Conquer] for most drops readded in a single update.
My main goals for this update was to focus on adding some more languages, continue the trend of focusing on better quality drops and add less overall than new ones, and focus on readding older removed drops which were pretty good and liked, but needed touching up to modern standards thus making it an "All-Stars" update.
